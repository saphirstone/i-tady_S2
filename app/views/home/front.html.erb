    <h3>What?</h3>
    <span>
      Socify is a social networking app built using Ruby on Rails. It's free &amp; completely open source. You can check the source on <a href="https://github.com/sudharti/socify"><%= fa_icon 'github' %> Github</a>. Also take a look at the demo deployed to <a href="http://socifyapp.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>.

    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <span>
      I am not building the next Facebook. Given that there are enough social networks already I don't want to end up launching one. Pointless! So why am I building? I want to try and learn how to develop a social network and in the process show you how easy it is done using Rails. Here is the <a href="https://medium.com/@sudharshanmuralidharaniyer/eb31da569233"><%= fa_icon 'medium' %> Blog post</a>.
    </span>
    <br>
    <h3>How?</h3>
    <span>
      As stated above it's a Ruby on Rails application. Frontend is developed using Twitter Bootstrap. Database is SQLite for development and Postgresql for production.
